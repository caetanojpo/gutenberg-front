## üìö Pages & Routes

The application has the following pages:

### 1. Login

- **URL**: `/`
- The landing page of the application with login to authenticate on the server.

### 2. Dashboard

- **URL**: `/dashboard`
- The user's main dashboard that provides insights and actions based on the application data.

üß± **Atomic Design in This Project**

In this project, we've adopted the Atomic Design methodology to build a scalable and maintainable UI. The components are structured into five levels:

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks like buttons, inputs, and icons are designed as reusable components.
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms, like form groups or card components, that are more complex yet still reusable.
- **Organisms**: Combinations of molecules forming more complex UI structures, such as headers or product lists.
- **Templates**: Page layouts formed by organisms, defining the structure without specific content.
- **Pages**: Final instances of templates, populated with real content, ready for display.

This approach ensures modularity, reusability, and consistency across the UI, making the project easy to scale and maintain.

## üìí **Architecture Notes**:

- **Context API**: For global state management and avoiding prop drilling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling, making it easy to adjust layout and appearance without writing custom CSS.
- **Next.js**: Offers file-based routing, SSR (server-side rendering), and automatic code splitting to optimize the app's performance.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety throughout the application for better developer experience and fewer runtime errors.
- **Figma Design**: Provides a clear visual and interactive prototype, ensuring the UI meets user expectations and business requirements.
